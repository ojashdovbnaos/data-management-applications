This project presents a complete data visualization pipeline built around a real-world dataset on dairy 
product sales. Our goal was to collect, clean, model, and visualize the data to uncover actionable insights 
into sales performance, inventory status, and customer distribution across India. Using MySQL, Python, 
and Tableau, we developed a relational database, implemented queries, and designed interactive 
dashboards. This system highlights the value of integrating structured data modeling with visual 
storytelling.
